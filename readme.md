# How New 6000-series Aluminum alloys perform under extreme tensile load

## 1. Dataset Overview

The reason why I choose this topic is because I did a undergrad project which utilized a lot of 6061 aluminum, and thus it is the material that I am more familiar with.  I want to predict the performance of unknown aluminum alloy that is produced by combining different 6000 series aluminum alloys with the given data. 

The propety.csv is the dataset base from the reference website, and the 6000-series-alloys.csv file is what I am mainly focusing on. I used AI tool to extract the specific data from the original property.csv file.

## 2. Dataset Content
- doi
- alloy name
- series (which I limited as 6000 series)
- caption (tested environment origin)
- AA_des (Aluminum Association Designation)
- YS (yielding strength)
- UTS (ultimate tensile strength)
- temper (heat treatment)
- elong (elongation)
- flag_note (special notes)

## 3. References
The dataset is from Material Cloud
